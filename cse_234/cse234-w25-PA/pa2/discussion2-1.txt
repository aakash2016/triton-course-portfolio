1. One of the plausible reasons why the custom implementation is slower than the built-in is that MPI might be using
some of the advanced and optimized algorithms discussed in class like the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) or Ring algorithm.
These algos handle communication much better and in an optimized manner. These implementations are not specialized for
the root/master.

On the other hand, the custom implementation involves
- Only rank 0 receiving data from all other ranks.
- Only rank 0 performing the reduction and sending the result to all ranks.

2. Another plausible reason is that MPI under the hood handles memory allocation and synchronization much more efficiently
than a custom implementation and uses specialized techniques to optimize network usage, which is harder to replicate manually.
